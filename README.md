### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working as a Data Science Intern at Flip Robo Technologies. I'm perusing PG Program in Data Science, Machine Learning and Neural Networks in collaboration with IBM from Data Trained Education. I am an aspiring Data Scientist and can transform raw data into processed data by organizing and cleaning the data. I'm passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating software applications and tools to help people, and building a community. Do ðŸŒŸ my repository if you find my project interesting, at least your star could make someone's day.
